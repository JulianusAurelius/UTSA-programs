"""
This script takes in stock prices (one number per line) and returns the maximum possible profit from buying one day and selling later


The professor said this couldbe done in O(nlogn) time, but I was able to find a solution in O(n) time, and perhaps a recursive solution in O(n) time as well
Due to that, the professor said he would not use this problem in future classes
